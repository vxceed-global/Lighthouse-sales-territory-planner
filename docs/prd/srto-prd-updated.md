Okay, this is a classic and valuable problem to solve. Let's break down the requirements for a product that can tackle sales route optimization with existing distributors (DTs) and outlets.

## Product Requirement Specification: Sales Route & Territory Optimizer

**1. Introduction**

*   **1.1 Purpose:** This document outlines the product requirements for a Sales Route & Territory Optimizer (SRTO). The SRTO will enable sales operations managers to design optimal sales territories for existing distributors, generate efficient daily/weekly routes and journey plans for salespeople, and provide tools for visualization, analysis, and manual adjustments.
*   **1.2 Scope:**
    *   **In Scope:**
        *   Territory design based on existing distributor locations and outlet assignments.
        *   Route optimization for individual salespeople assigned to distributors.
        *   Journey plan generation with pattern-based storage.
        *   Visualization of territories, routes, and outlets on a map.
        *   Reporting on key metrics (e.g., travel time, outlets visited, expected sales).
        *   Manual override capabilities for outlet assignment and route adjustments.
        *   Configuration of various business rules and constraints.
        *   Sales calendar management and integration.
    *   **Out of Scope:**
        *   Optimization of distributor locations (DTs are assumed fixed).
        *   Full Route-to-Market (RTM) design (e.g., determining optimal number of DTs, DT capacities beyond salesperson assignments).
        *   Real-time tracking of salespeople (though generated plans could be exported for such systems).
        *   Inventory management at DT or outlet level.
        *   Order taking or CRM functionalities (though it can integrate with or use data from these systems).
        *   Demand forecasting (though it will use forecast data as input).
*   **1.3 Intended Users:**
    *   **Sales Operations Manager/Planner:** Primary user responsible for configuring, running optimizations, analyzing results, and making manual adjustments.
    *   **Sales Manager:** Reviews plans, monitors territory performance.
    *   **System Administrator:** Manages user accounts, data imports, and system settings.

    *   **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solvers:** This is the heart of route optimization.
        *   **Heuristics:** Clarke & Wright Savings, Sweep Algorithm.
        *   **Metaheuristics:** Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization (often necessary for large, complex problems).
        *   Commercial or open-source VRP solvers (e.g., OR-Tools, OptaPlanner, Jsprit).
    *   **Journey Plan Generation:** Pattern-based algorithms that convert daily routes into weekly/monthly patterns while respecting visit frequencies and calendar constraints.
*   **5.2 Mapping & Geocoding:**
    *   Utilize mapping APIs/SDKs (e.g., Google Maps Platform, Mapbox, Leaflet with OpenStreetMap data).
    *   These services often provide geocoding and route calculation (distance/time matrix) capabilities.

*   **5.4 Data Derivation:**
    *   **Service Level Tiering:** Could be derived externally or by a simple module within the SRTO based on rules (e.g., sales volume percentile, strategic importance). This tiering then drives visit frequency and potentially service time.
    *   **Sales Forecast/NPPD:** Assumed as an input, used to calculate potential value of outlets/territories.

**6. Future Considerations (Potential Enhancements)**

*   **6.5 Mobile Companion App:** For salespeople to receive and update journey plans.
*   **6.6 Advanced Analytics & AI:** Predictive insights on route performance, churn risk based on visit patterns, etc.

This PRS provides a solid foundation for developing a Sales Route & Territory Optimizer. The next steps would involve prioritizing these requirements (e.g., using MoSCoW), creating user stories, and designing the UI/UX.
