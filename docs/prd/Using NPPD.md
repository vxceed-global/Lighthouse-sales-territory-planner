# Using "Next Product Purchase Date" (NPPD) with a probability of purchase, combined with demand forecast, is a much more direct and powerful input for route optimization, especially for prioritizing daily visits.

The core idea is that NPPD + Demand Forecast helps you identify the *hot_list* of outlets to visit on any given day to maximize sales potential.

Here's the updated perspective on how historical sales order information and **NPPD (Next Product Purchase Date)** would be used:

**Using Historical Sales Order Information & NPPD in Sales Route Optimization**

Historical sales order information remains foundational, and NPPD adds a dynamic, predictive layer for visit prioritization.

**A. Using Historical Sales Order Information (Largely as before, but with context for NPPD):**

1.  **Deriving Service Level Tiers & Baseline Visit Frequency:**
    *   **How:** Analyze historical sales data (volume, value, order frequency, product mix/LPO) to segment outlets into tiers (e.g., Gold, Silver, Bronze).
    *   **Impact on Optimization:**
        *   **Baseline Visit Frequency:** These tiers establish the *minimum required visit frequency* (e.g., Gold = weekly, Silver = bi-weekly). This is a fundamental constraint the route optimizer must try to meet over a planning cycle (e.g., monthly). FR2.3.3 (Multi-Day Planning) becomes critical here.
        *   **Resource Allocation Basis:** Strategic outlets (higher tiers) are marked for more frequent attention.

2.  **Estimating Average Time Spent in Outlet:**
    *   **How:**
        *   Correlate historical order complexity (LPO, order value) with time spent.
        *   Set default "time spent in outlet" per tier or for specific high-volume outlets.
    *   **Impact on Optimization:** More accurate service time input (FR2.1.1, FR2.3.1) for realistic route scheduling.

3.  **Setting Overall Productivity Targets & Order Size Goals:**
    *   **How:** Analyze historical averages for order size (value/units) and LPO per outlet/tier.
    *   **Impact on Optimization:**
        *   These are benchmarks for evaluating territory/route effectiveness (FR2.5.1). While NPPD guides *which* outlet to visit for immediate sales, historical data sets overall expectations for the *type* of sales.

4.  **Informing Baseline "Expected Sales" & Long-Term Territory Balancing:**
    *   **How:** Sum of historical sales provides a baseline for an outlet's general contribution.
    *   **Impact on Optimization:**
        *   **Territory Design (FR2.2.3):** Useful for balancing territories based on overall historical sales potential, ensuring a fair distribution of established business.
        *   **Long-Term Reporting (FR2.5.1, FR2.5.2):** Tracks overall territory performance against historical benchmarks.

5.  **Validating and Refining Outlet Data:**
    *   **How:** Identify inactive outlets (no sales for X period) or misclassified channels based on purchase history.
    *   **Impact on Optimization:** Ensures data hygiene for more accurate planning.

**B. Using NPPD (Next Product Purchase Date) & Demand Forecast:**

This is where the dynamic, daily prioritization comes in. NPPD tells you *when* an outlet is most likely to buy *specific products*, and the demand forecast tells you *how much*.

1.  **Daily Outlet Visit Prioritization & Scoring:**
    *   **How:**
        *   For each planning day, the system ingests NPPD data (Outlet ID, Product ID, Predicted Purchase Date, Purchase Probability) and the Demand Forecast (Outlet ID, Product ID, Forecasted Demand for that day).
        *   A "Visit Urgency Score" or "Potential Sales Value for Visit" can be calculated for each outlet for that specific day. This score could be a function of:
            *   Probability of purchase from NPPD.
            *   Forecasted demand value for products with high NPPD probability.
            *   Margin on those products (if available).
    *   **Impact on Optimization:**
        *   **Outlet Selection for Daily Routes:** When generating daily routes (FR2.3.1), the optimizer can be configured to prioritize outlets with the highest "Visit Urgency Score" for that day, *while still respecting baseline visit frequencies from service tiers and other constraints (working hours, travel time)*.
        *   **Objective Function Weighting:** The optimization goal (FR2.3.2) can include maximizing the sum of "Potential Sales Value for Visit" for the outlets included in the day's routes.
        *   **Tie-Breaking:** If multiple routes are feasible, the one covering outlets with higher collective NPPD-driven scores could be preferred.

2.  **Optimizing Visit Timing within a Cycle:**
    *   **How:** For an outlet that needs, say, one visit per week (based on its tier), NPPD can help determine the *optimal day within that week* to make the visit. If NPPD indicates a high purchase probability for key products on Tuesday, the system will try to schedule the visit for Tuesday.
    *   **Impact on Optimization:** Improves the effectiveness of each visit by aligning it with peak purchase likelihood, thus directly impacting "Productivity targets."

3.  **Informing "Expected Sales for the Day/Route":**
    *   **How:** The sum of (NPPD Probability * Demand Forecast Value) for products at visited outlets gives a more dynamic and granular "expected sales for the day" (FR2.5.1) than just historical averages.
    *   **Impact on Optimization:** Provides a forward-looking metric for evaluating route quality. The "View expected sales" output becomes much more actionable.

4.  **Dynamic Workload Balancing (Potentially):**
    *   **How:** If NPPD data indicates that an unusually high number of high-potential outlets are "hot" on the same day, this could flag a potential workload imbalance for the salespeople in that area.
    *   **Impact on Optimization:** The system might try to distribute these visits if possible, or highlight the need for potential temporary support or reprioritization if all "hot" outlets cannot be covered.

5.  **Refining Call Objectives for Salespeople:**
    *   **How:** The journey plan (FR2.4.1) can not only list outlets but also highlight *which products* have a high NPPD score for that specific outlet on that day.
    *   **Impact on Optimization (Indirect):** While the SRTO plans the route, this information enhances the salesperson's effectiveness during the visit, making the optimized route more productive.

**Data Integration Requirements for NPPD & Demand Forecast:**

*   **NPPD Data Input:**
    *   Outlet ID
    *   Product ID / SKU
    *   Predicted Next Purchase Date
    *   Probability of Purchase (for that date)
*   **Demand Forecast Data Input:**
    *   Outlet ID
    *   Product ID / SKU
    *   Date
    *   Forecasted Demand Quantity/Value
*   **Processing:** The SRTO needs to efficiently join this data with outlet master data and use it in its daily optimization logic. The system should be able to handle time-sensitive data effectively.

**In Summary of Changes:**

*   Historical data is primarily for establishing **baseline service levels, visit frequencies, average service times, and long-term performance benchmarks.**
*   **NPPD + Demand Forecast** provides a dynamic, daily, and product-specific layer for **prioritizing which outlets to visit *today* (or this week) and what to focus on during the visit to maximize immediate sales conversion.**

This combination allows the Sales Route & Territory Optimizer to be both strategically sound (covering the right outlets with the right base frequency) and tactically astute (visiting them when they are most likely to buy specific products).
