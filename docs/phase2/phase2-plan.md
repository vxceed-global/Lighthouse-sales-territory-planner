# 🚧 Phase 2: Core Features Development

**Branch**: `phase2`  
**Started**: June 8, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress

## 🎯 Phase 2 Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Outlet Management** - Complete CRUD operations for outlets
- **API Integration** - Connect frontend to backend services
- **Route Optimization UI** - User interface for route optimization

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Outlet list with filtering and search
- [ ] Add/Edit outlet forms with validation
- [ ] API layer with RTK Query
- [ ] Route optimization controls
- [ ] Territory boundary visualization
- [ ] Real data integration (replace sample data)

## 📋 Development Plan

### Week 1: Data Management Foundation
- [ ] Implement Redux slices for outlets, routes, territories
- [ ] Set up RTK Query for API integration
- [ ] Create loading states and error handling
- [ ] Build outlet management components

### Week 2: Outlet Management
- [ ] Outlet list with advanced filtering
- [ ] Add/Edit outlet forms
- [ ] Outlet details view
- [ ] Integration with map markers

### Week 3: Route Optimization
- [ ] Route optimization controls UI
- [ ] Manual route adjustment tools
- [ ] Real-time optimization feedback
- [ ] Route visualization improvements

### Week 4: Territory Management
- [ ] Territory boundary drawing
- [ ] Outlet assignment interface
- [ ] Territory analytics
- [ ] Performance optimizations
