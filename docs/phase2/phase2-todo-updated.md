## üîç Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Import-First Approach**: Focus on data import rather than CRUD ‚úÖ
2. **Databricks-Centric**: Unity Catalog as single source of truth ‚úÖ
3. **Pre-computed Snapshots**: Territory data cached for performance (Option A chosen) ‚úÖ
4. **System-Guided Setup**: Automated territory size validation ‚úÖ
5. **Explicit Locking**: User-controlled session management (no auto-release) ‚úÖ
6. **Comprehensive Audit**: All actions tracked with reasons ‚úÖ
7. **GT/MT Channel Split**: Separate workspaces and workflows ‚úÖ
8. **Pre-sales Focus**: Phase 2 limited to pre-sales role ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| Large file import failures | High | Chunked uploads, resume capability | Designed ‚úÖ |
| Territory too large for snapshot | High | System-guided splits, size validation | Designed ‚úÖ |
| Lock conflicts | Medium | Clear UI feedback, no auto-release | Designed ‚úÖ |
| Data quality issues | High | Validation reports, manual assignment | Designed ‚úÖ |
| Performance at scale | High | Pre-computation, CDN, caching | Designed ‚úÖ |
| Cost overruns | Medium | Usage monitoring, optimization strategies | Estimated ‚úÖ |

## üìä Success Metrics

- [ ] Import 1M outlets in < 30 minutes
- [ ] Territory load time < 5 seconds  
- [ ] API response time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Route optimization < 2 minutes for 50K outlets
- [ ] Zero data loss during import
- [ ] 95% auto-mapping accuracy
- [ ] Support 100 concurrent planning sessions
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
